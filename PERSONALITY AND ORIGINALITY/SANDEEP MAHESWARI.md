# SANDEEP MAHESHWARI

- Over Thinking is not at all bad, but bad thinking is. What based on beliefs are wrong thinking , but based on reality is good thinking .

- Conflicted mind leads to problematic mind 

- Spending some time doing nothing or relaxing brain is like a formatted computer , when processes information instantly, or there is no state such as being demotivated , But thinking that I'm demotivated is even more harmful .Our that state of mind should be utilized 

- In hyper action mode we do not think much

- We can meditate anywhere and anytime by being aware of what is happening in our surroundings
