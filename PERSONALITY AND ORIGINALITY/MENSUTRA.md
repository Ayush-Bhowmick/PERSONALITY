- You are so  disconnected from yourself that you are learning to be somebody else…
- Think it, don't say it loud .Don't be a dog who knows only to bark….
- The World owes nothing to you … So stop blaming
- If you are happy about doing it,happiness is not a destination, it's the by-product of doing the right thing.
- Your goal in life is your destination and the journey towards it composed of very hard choices and actions. Take RESPONSIBILTY of         your actions.
- Reduce your excuses and maximize your actions.
- Out of 100 most richest people/Billionaires, 73% are self made,18 have no college degree and 36 are from poor family. What the hell   are you whining about?
- Be SELFISH for once and your future self will thank for it…
- It takes one decision to eradicate all distractions.

- Erase the existence of parents n your life, and ask:
    1.	Who are you
    2.	what have you done in your life
    3.	what do I want to do ?
    4.	why haven't i done it ?
