# **LEAVE THE WORLD BETTER THAN YOU FOUND IT**

- The root of the word passionate is the willing to suffer
- Are you playing the short game or The Long Game
- Nothing fails like success
- Success shifts humility to arrogance in a person 
- Learn even more with success to be the Titan in your Field
- Age is just an number don't let an old body into your body
- The hours ordinary people waste , extraordinary people do
- Don't waste your each day , leverage your each day
- We should raise our game to a place called world class to be known as a game changer
- Every visionary  people was first ridiculed before they were revered 
- The Spartans said ---
    ` Those who sweats more in Training , They Bleed less in War`

- Addiction to distraction is the death of creative production
- He or She who Learns the More wins The More
- A Great Life is not Built by Revolution but by Evolution
- Small and steady Wins The Race
- What you do every days is far more Important than what you every decade
- The Things that break your heart , if you choose are the ones that open your heart
- Fear is only an opportunity for bravery training
- We only make excuses as we are very good at Self Deception
- We are sometimes addicted to pain and crisis  which we have to leave to go to the possibility of pleasure and joy of greatness 
- You don't get lucky you make lucky

- Changes are hard a the beginning , messy in the middle and gorgeous at the end 
- Education is inoculation  against disruption
- The things that get scheduled are the things that get done
